Our Learnings
On this journey we faced many issues, but we keep motivated each other with patience.

We all learned how to read and understand the code of other team members.

We learned how to write more efficient and clean code.

Even though We also learned how to plan a project and how to execute it step by step.

By this Project we have learned how to collaborate and communicate with team effectively and improving the productivity.

We also got a glimpse of using GitHub for the version control.
